**Q:**  
> MIT 6.00 vs MIT 6.00 SC? On the MIT OpenCourseWare website they have listed two courses, MIT 6.00 and MIT 6.00 SC. Are they the same? If I am planning to take one course, which one should I take?  

**A:**  
> The \"SC\" in 6.00SC \(and other X.XXSC subjects on OCW\) indicates that the subject is an OCW Scholar course, meaning that it is "designed >\[specifically\] for independent learners" and is "substantially more complete than typical OCW courses and include\[s\] new custom-created content as well as materials repurposed from MIT classrooms," as opposed to regular OCW subjects, which are essentially videotaped lectures and problem sets from the actual MIT class posted online without specific attention being paid to tailoring them for online independent learners.
